1. [Temporal Analysis](https://github.com/molly-cliff/Burkina-Faso-meningitis-outbreaks-INLA/blob/main/1.Temporal-analysis.R):Uses Bayesian spatiotemporal modeling with INLA (Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation) to investigate temporal trends in outbreak occurrence in Burkina Faso. The models explore how the probability of an outbreak changes over time (monthly), using various temporal structures that capture smooth, correlated, or cyclical effects.
