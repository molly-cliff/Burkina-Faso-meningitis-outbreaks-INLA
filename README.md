1. [Temporal Analysis](https://github.com/molly-cliff/Burkina-Faso-meningitis-outbreaks-INLA/blob/main/1.Temporal-analysis.R): Uses Bayesian spatiotemporal modeling with INLA (Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation) to investigate temporal trends in outbreak occurrence in Burkina Faso. The models explore how the probability of an outbreak changes over time (monthly from 2003-2022), using various temporal structures that capture smooth, correlated, or cyclical effects.

2. [Spatial Analysis](https://github.com/molly-cliff/Burkina-Faso-meningitis-outbreaks-INLA/blob/main/Spatial-analysis.R): Compares multiple spatial model structures(BYM, BYM2, Besag, and Besag Proper)to assess which best explains the occurrence of outbreaks across space and time. Time component used (AR1 cont-month) is from the best performing model in the previous Temporal Analysis.
